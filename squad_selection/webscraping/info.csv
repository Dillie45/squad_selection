1,Shubman Gill,"September 08, 1999, Fazilka, Punjab",23y 354d,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Opening Batter,"A right-hand top-order batsman from Punjab, Shubman Gill is known for his penchant for big runs and was hence drafted into India Under-19 side as the vice-captain for the 2018 World Cup. He made his first-class debut before that, for Punjab in the Ranji Trophy in late 2017 with a half-century in the game and an attacking 129 in the next match.A constant feature in Rahul Dravid's plans for the Under-19 World Cup, Gill constantly played at an age-group level above his. In 2014, he smacked 351 in Punjab's Inter-District Under-16 tournament, and shared a record opening stand of 587 with Nirmal Singh. On his Under-16 state debut for Punjab, he made an unbeaten double-century in the Vijay Merchant Trophy. Later that year, he went on to share the stage with his idol Virat Kohli while receiving a BCCI award for the best junior cricketer, which he won for two successive years: 2013-14 and 2014-15.When picked for the national Under-19 side, he amassed 351 runs in four innings to be named the Man of the Series during the Youth ODI series at home against England. In the reciprocal tour, his first in English conditions, he top-scored once more, with 278 runs in four innings. India swept both series.While he was still in New Zealand for the World Cup on the day of the 2018 IPL auction, Gill was picked by Kolkata Knight Riders for INR 1.8 crore (USD 281,000 approx)."
2,Virat Kohli,"November 05, 1988, Delhi",34y 296d,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Top order Batter,"India has given to the world many a great cricketer but perhaps none as ambitious as Virat Kohli. To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them.This ambition transferred seamlessly to his captaincy: he demanded more than ever of his bowlers especially the quick ones, often sacrificed a batsman for bowling depth, and led India to a long stay at No. 1 in Test rankings and a first-ever series win in Australia. He is well on his way to end up as India's most successful Test captain.Barring one in Bangladesh, Kohli scored Test hundreds in and against every country he played. He absolutely smashed records for number of matches taken to reach eight, nine, ten and eleven thousand ODI runs. He was a genuine threat to Sachin Tendulkar's record of 49 ODI and 51 Test hundreds.An Under-19 world Cup-winning captain, when he burst onto the scene, Kohli was a precocious talent with a cover drive to kill for. He was destined to be India's next big batsman as the Tendulkar era began to retire, but Kohli wanted to be more: a cricketer whom the opposition would be in awe of, a cricketer whose presence would raise the intensity of the contest. He lived every ball, competed each moment, and made sure he had the fitness and strength to do so. He was widely credited for changing the fitness culture in Indian cricket, introducing endurance tests as a criterion for selection.Kohli was quite simply India's most powerful captain. Centre of every marketing campaign for Indian cricket, he also happened to lead at a time when the BCCI was run by interim administrators who knew better than to draw the ire of Indian cricket's biggest star. There was never any cause to doubt his intent: to do things that will win matches for India, which they did plenty under him."
3,Shikhar Dhawan,"December 05, 1985, Delhi",37y 266d,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Opening Batter,"Shikhar Dhawan stunned all observers, and Australia, when he stroked his way to the fastest Test century by a debutant. That debut, in Mohali in 2012-13, came to Dhawan in his ninth year of first-class cricket after he had been written off by almost everybody, not least because India's opening combination had been fixed to the most prolific combination in their Test history: Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir.Dhawan is one in a long line of stroke-players from Delhi, which became the Indian batting capital in the 2000s. He stands upright in his stance, is a bit stiff with his hands when he pushes forward, and is partial to the cover-drive. Those who played domestic cricket with him say he is supremely confident, bordering on showmanship. He is also a flamboyant personality with his ever-changing looks and the twirled moustache.However, the attractive strokes, which were apparent even in the 2003-04 Under-19 World Cup where he was the Player of the Tournament for scoring 505 runs at 84.16 with three centuries, didn't seem to translate into huge seasons in Ranji Trophy. His average stayed steady in the mid-40s, but he didn't quite dare the selectors to overlook him. After lukewarm showing in the IPL and five ODIs, and with the Test openers going well, it seemed Dhawan would be left consigned to domestic cricket and T20 leagues.Fortune turned, though, and both Sehwag and Gambhir lost form dramatically, giving Dhawan a chance at the age of 27 with 81 caps and 5679 first-class runs to his name already. Dhawan grabbed the chance with arguably the best debut by an Indian batsman, smashing 187 off 174 balls to set up India's win in a Test that was reduced to four days. He was picked in India's squad for the Champions Trophy soon after, and carried his sizzling form into that tournament with two centuries in the side's first two matches.Dhawan's form later tailed off in England and Australia in 2014 but he hit back with 412 runs at 51.50 in India's run to the 2015 World Cup semi-finals.Sidharth Monga"
4,Shreyas Santosh Iyer,"December 06, 1994, Mumbai",28y 265d,Right hand Bat,"Right arm Offbreak, Legbreak Googly",Top order Batter,"Shreyas Iyer is an attacking top-order batter capable of marrying classical shots with brute force.He made headlines when Delhi Daredevils bought him at the 2015 IPL auction for Rs 2.6 crore (about US$416,000). It was faith he repaid with interest: he made 439 runs that season, and won the IPL Emerging Player of the Year award. Over the next six seasons, he became a mainstay of the side and its captain, making over 400 runs a season for them four times.Iyer came up through the Under-19 ranks, hitting back-to-back fifties in the 2014 World Cup playoffs to help India finish fifth. He made his first-class debut for Mumbai the next domestic season, and after a lukewarm stint in the middle order, was promoted to opener and finished as the team's top run-getter with 809 runs at an average of over 50. He had a blow-out Ranji Trophy season the next year, with 1321 runs at 73, and made a century in the final, where Mumbai won their 41st title.By then calls for Iyer to be fast-tracked into the India side had grown clamorous, but it took nearly another two years before he made his international debut, in the white-ball formats first. His first hundred for India came in an ODI against New Zealand in Hamilton in 2020, and he made a century and fifty on Test debut against the same side a little over a year and a half later, this time at home. In a Ranchi ODI in October 2022, he made a chase of 282 against South Africa look like a walk in a park with a well-paced unbeaten 113 that took India home with plenty of room to spare."
5,Kannaur Lokesh Rahul,"April 18, 1992, Bangalore, Karnataka",31y 132d,Right hand Bat,Wicketkeeper,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A tall, elegant right-hand batsman who can keep wicket in a crisis, KL Rahul is among the most highly rated opening batsmen in India's next generation. Rahul was a part of India's squad in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup and made his first-class debut later that year. Having taken a while to establish himself as a first-class cricketer, he enjoyed a breakthrough 2013-14 season, laying the foundation for Karnataka's Ranji Trophy victory with 1033 runs, which included three centuries, three nineties, and a Man-of-the-Match performance in the final.Rahul attracted plenty of attention at the subsequent IPL auction, and finally went to Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs. 1 crore (US$ 166,000 approx.). He was a regular member of their side in the 2014 season, mostly as wicketkeeper-batsman, but his contributions with the bat were steady rather than spectacular.In the long format, however, his technique and application have impressed some of Indian cricket's most respected names. These include Rahul Dravid, with whom Rahul shares not just a name but also a strong rapport, regularly seeking him out for technical and mental advice.Rahul had a middling tour of Australia with the India A team in July-August 2014, getting starts each time he batted in the unofficial Tests but only managing a top score of 52. But his appetite for runs was back to normal by the time the 2014-15 domestic season began, and twin centuries in the Duleep Trophy final earned him a place in India's Test squad on their tour of Australia.A profitable IPL in 2016 set him up to make the Indian ODI and T20 squad that toured Zimbabwe in June, where he became the first batsman from his country to score a century on debut in 50-over cricket.Karthik Krishnaswamy"
6,Rohit Gurunath Sharma,"April 30, 1987, Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra",36y 120d,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"Languid and easy on the eye, Rohit Sharma owned all the shots in the book when he emerged from the Mumbai suburbs as heir apparent to the Indian batting greats of the 2000s. It took him time and persistence, but by the 2010s he had become a colossus in white-ball cricket, and the man in charge of perhaps the most formidable league team in the first age of T20.That Rohit had talent was apparent to both the casual observer and to the trained eye. Fans were frustrated at the long wait for the potential to translate into runs, though selectors and captains, knowing better, kept backing him. At one point the word ""talent"" was Rohit's bugbear, a pejorative nickname for him on social media. Once it all clicked, though - the move to open the batting in ODIs late in 2012 was one particular turning point - things came together spectacularly.Rohit scored ODI double-hundreds for fun, won six IPLs in the first 15 editions of the tournament, scored five hundreds at the 2019 ODI World Cup, and when he finally got to open in Tests in 2019, three quick hundreds in his first series in the role, one of them a double.Ironically his IPL franchise nicknamed him ""Hitman"" when he was anything but: more caresser, less hitter. But Rohit still became known as one of the foremost hitters of colossal sixes of his era. So spectacular and certain was his acceleration that people began anticipate a massive score every time he went past 50.His captaincy at Mumbai Indians, whom he led to five titles, won plaudits. He proved himself a methodical, studious and calm leader, one not averse to using technology and data to arrive at decisions. He was an able deputy to Virat Kohli in limited-overs formats in international cricket, winning India two titles in Kohli's absence, and took over as captain in all formats in 2022."
7,Hardik Himanshu Pandya,"October 11, 1993, Choryasi, Gujarat",29y 321d,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Allrounder,"Allrounder Hardik Pandya's calling cards brisk seam bowling and powerful ball-striking marked by the ability to hit sixes from the first ball.Hardik, who plays his domestic cricket for Baroda, first caught the eye with an unbeaten 31-ball 61 for Mumbai Indians against Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2015 IPL. That began a long association with Mumbai, where he won four trophies and gained acclaim as a formidable finisher. By the end of the 2022 T20 World Cup, he had come to be seen as a future India captain, thanks to the leadership skills he showed that year in turning an unfancied Gujarat Titans line-up into IPL champions in their first year of existence.Hardik began his India career in 2016 when he was called up for a limited-overs tour to Australia, before impressing with the ball on seamer-friendly pitches in Bangladesh at the Asia Cup. He appeared to be the answer to India's search for a seam-bowling allrounder, and with his sprightly fielding added to the mix, he sealed his spot in India's squad for that year's T20 World Cup.While Hardik batted only twice in the tournament, he bowled the last over against Bangladesh, defending two runs off three balls to help India to a one-run win. A little more than a week after that, Pandya endured the disappointment of bowling a no-ball to reprieve Lendl Simmons, whose unbeaten innings helped eventual champions West Indies clinch the semi-final.Since then, it has not been all smooth sailing. The impact of a serious back injury in 2018 continues to follow Hardik, sometimes limiting him from being able to bowl. And early in 2019, he was embroiled in controversy when he made misogynistic and racist remarks on a talk show, for which he was pulled up by the Indian board.In the 2020s, Hardik grew into his role as a senior player and won praise for his faith in players as a captain and for being a free-thinker. In 2022, after India beat Pakistan in the T20 World Cup, he said he wouldn't have minded losing because the match was so much fun - sentiments he echoed after the 2023 IPL final, where he was all praise for rival captain MS Dhoni, whose Chennai Super Kings beat Gujarat Titans for the title. That year, like in the one before, Hardik turned in an impressive all-round and captaincy performance, making 346 runs and taking nine wickets in Gujarat Titans' run to their second final in a row."
8,Ishan Pranav Kumar Pandey Kishan,"July 18, 1998, Patna, Bihar",25y 41d,Left hand Bat,Wicketkeeper,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A wicketkeeper and left-handed opening batsman from Jharkhand, the same state MS Dhoni hails from, Ishan Kishan led India at the Under-19 World Cup in 2016 in Bangladesh, where his team finished runners-up to West Indies.Even though India had a successful tournament, Kishan struggled for form on seamer-friendly tracks, scoring just 73 runs in six innings.He was first noticed when he struck a 69-ball 87, studded with eight sixes, on a rank Rajkot turner in a Ranji Trophy clash against Saurashtra in October 2015. He then led India Under-19s to a one-day tri-series win in Sri Lanka, also involving the hosts and England, two months later.  He had made his first-class debut for Jharkhand in December 2014 and scored a century and five fifties in his first ten first-class matches.His attacking approach to batting had him picked by Gujarat Lions in the 2016 IPL auction for INR 35 lakh ($US 52,000 approx) at the age of 17."
9,Rishabh Rajendra Pant,"October 04, 1997, Haridwar, Uttarakhand",25y 328d,Left hand Bat,Wicketkeeper,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A match-turning, swashbuckling batter-keeper in the Adam Gilchrist mould, Rishabh Pant has had a starring role in more than a handful of India's biggest Test matches in his first few years in the team.His first Test century came in his third match, on the 2018 tour of England, when he made 114 from No. 7 when up against a target of 464 that he made look almost gettable at points when he was at the crease. Early the following year he produced 159 off 189 balls in a giant India total in Sydney, which sealed their first series in Australia. An encore followed early in 2021, when he made a brisk 97 at the SCG, helping wrest a draw off Starc, Cummins, Lyon and Hazlewood after India were staring down the barrel.Pant's finest batting hour came in the classic that followed in Brisbane: an unbeaten 89 to steer a veritable India third XI home in a tall chase, and to their second series win down under in two visits. In Cape Town at the start of 2022, he made an almost ludicrous 100 off 139 in an India total where the next highest score was 29. And later that year, he set India up with a rapid 146 in the first innings of the postponed last Test of their tour of England from 2021 - only for England to outgun them in a berserker fourth-innings chase.It is a mark of Pant's no-fear, no-brakes batting that in his first four years in the game, he had as many scores between 90 and 100 in Tests as he did hundreds. It is the only way he has known: a year after making his Ranji Trophy debut at 18 in 2015, Pant scored a triple-hundred against Maharashtra, followed by two blistering centuries in a game against Jharkhand a month on - one of them ending in 135 off 67 balls.With Test stats like his, Pant's numbers in T20 - close to 3000 runs over seven seasons for Delhi Capitals, at a strike rate of 148 - don't seem especially remarkable, but he has been a force for the Delhi side, their all-time top-scorer, and was appointed captain in 2021. He was bought at auction by the franchise the day he made a hundred in the 2016 Under-19 World Cup that took India into the semi-finals of that tournament."
10,Suryakumar Ashok Yadav,"September 14, 1990, Mumbai, Maharashtra",32y 348d,Right hand Bat,"Right arm Medium, Right arm Offbreak",Batter,"Hard-hitting 360-degree batter Suryakumar Yadav has all the shots, including a few not in any textbook save the one written by AB de Villiers. he also has a yen for making batting look easy, as he showed during four golden years with Mumbai Indians starting in 2018, during which they won the IPL title twice, thanks in no small part to his 1700-plus runs at a strike rate of around 140.He made 73 on his Ranji Trophy debut, for Mumbai in 2010, and the following season scored 754 from nine games, the most by anyone from his team. That tally included a double-century against Orissa in his third match of the season, and a hundred in the next. He capped the season with yet another hundred, in the Duleep Trophy. After a blip in 2012-13, he was back among the runs the next season, where he finished among Mumbai's top three run-getters.Suryakumar spent four seasons with Kolkata Knight Riders, starting in their second IPL title-winning year, 2014, though with 608 runs from 54 games he didn't quite provide a foretaste of what he would go on to do with Mumbai Indians in the years that followed.Suryakumar's first international came belatedly in 2021, whereupon he hooked the first ball he faced in a T20I, from Jofra Archer, for six. He produced two fifties in his first three T20Is, and the year after, made 117 off 55 in a game where India fell short in the face of a massive 215 by England."
11,Sanju Viswanath Samson,"November 11, 1994, Pulluvila, Vizhinjam, Trivandrum",28y 290d,Right hand Bat,Wicketkeeper,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Sanju Samson was perhaps the first top-drawer Indian player to be known primarily for his feats for his IPL franchise than for the national side. A Rajasthan Royals mainstay, he has made over 3000 runs for them in the course of his first eight seasons.Samson moved to Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala in his early teens after taking his first cricket lessons in Delhi, where his father worked as a police constable. In Kerala, he created waves on the junior circuit with his batting, showing impressive technique and an ability to time the ball crisply. He made it to the India side for the Under-19 Asia Cup in 2011 but did not impress in the tournament, and missed out on selection for India's U-19 World Cup side the following year.Rajasthan Royals bought Samson at the IPL auction in 2013, when he was 18, and save for the two years when the side was out of the league for a ban, he has been a fixture in their line-up. He was appointed captain in 2021, when he made 484 runs, kicking off with a barnstorming 119 off 63 balls in their tournament opener, against Punjab Kings, followed by three 40s in a row later in the season, and then an unbeaten 70 and 82 in back-to-back games. His fine, consistent displays did not reflect in Royals' finishes on the tournament's points table, which continued to be disappointing up until 2022, when they were second (Samson made 458 runs that year).He made his first-class debut in 2011-12, and impressed with bat and as keeper for Kerala in the Ranji Trophy. In 2013-14 he finished with 530 runs at an average of just under 60, including a double-hundred in his first game; that was followed by 475 runs the next season. In 2015-16, he was 20 when he was appointed captain of the Kerala side. In October 2019, in a showcase of his by then formidable white-ball skills, Samson made 212 not out, the highest score in the history of the Vijay Hazare Trophy at the time, for Kerala against Goa.A call-up to the India T20 side came in July 2015, and he made his debut against Zimbabwe in Harare, but then went four and a half years before his next game in the format for India. He made his ODI debut in 2021, which was followed a gap again, of a year before he played his next ODI - in a series in the West Indies, where he made 54 in the second match."
12,Ravindrasinh Anirudhsinh Jadeja,"December 06, 1988, Navagam-Khed, Saurashtra",34y 265d,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder,"Dissed when he first appeared, Ravindra Jadeja won the doubters and haters over with his deeds, and now sits among the elite of Indian spin bowling.In October 2019 he became the quickest left-arm bowler to reach 200 Test wickets. Six years before that, he had became the first Indian since Anil Kumble in 1993 to top the ICC ODI bowling rankings. In the IPL, he drew a scarcely believable bid of US$2 million in 2012.In an era in which he was bound to be overshadowed by the artistry of fellow spinner R Ashwin, Jadeja kept his senior colleague on his toes, and often stole the spot when conditions allowed India to play just the one spinner. It helped that he was a captain's dream: arguably the fastest man on the turf and the best fielder in the time that he played, he went on to become an important lower-order batter.Some of his best batting performances came against the top teams, and they were often accompanied by the swordsman's celebration that became his signature. Ten years into his career, he had five Test fifties and a hundred against England - the latter in a partnership of 222 with Rishabh Pant at Edgbaston in 2022 - and four half-centuries against Australia. It was all a far cry from the memes his batting inspired at the start of his career - though the ridicule directed at his three triple-hundreds in domestic cricket back then was more an indictment of the quality of bowling on the Indian first-class circuit at the time.Jadeja shone in India's 2013 Champions Trophy win, finishing as the leading wicket-taker, with 12 wickets, two of those in the final, where he also made an unbeaten 33.His most valuable assets as a bowler are perhaps his fitness and strength, which enable him to go at batters for hours, ready to pounce on any assistance from the pitch. Like with his batting, his bowling highlights too feature the best sides disproportionately. His first Test five-for came against Australia in Delhi in 2013, and was followed by 6 for 138 in his next match, against South Africa in Durban, though that was in an India defeat. When South Africa next visited India, he got stuck into them, with 23 wickets in the four Tests in 2015. Against England at home in 2016-17, he harvested 26; this included an impressive demolition job in Chennai, where he took 7 for 48 after India had racked up 759 runs. Later that season he took 25 wickets when Australia visited for four Tests, to go with the 24 from the previous time, in 2013.Through the first half of his career and beyond, Jadeja's place in the Test side was never quite secure. He had to fight through a serious shoulder injury, and he was even dropped from the squad, but he kept coming back. Of course, these hardships paled in comparison with a tough childhood in Jamnagar, and the hard knocks that marked his early career, including being banned by the IPL for a year for essentially trying to negotiate his salary. In that tournament, Jadeja has been synonymous with Chennai Super Kings, for whom he has taken over 100 wickets over nine seasons and whom he briefly captained in 2022."
13,Shardul Narendra Thakur,"October 16, 1991, Palghar, Maharashtra",31y 316d,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Bowler,"An aggressive quick bowler, who can swing the ball away from the right-handers even while hitting the pitch hard, Shardul Thakur has established himself as the spearhead of Mumbai's attack. With the new ball, Thakur's at-the-batsman method forms a neat counterpoint to Dhawal Kulkarni's more metronomic style, and the two combined brilliantly to win Mumbai their 41st Ranji Trophy title in February 2016. Thakur picked up eight wickets in the final against Saurashtra, and his dismissal of Cheteshwar Pujara on the third day, the ball rearing up from a length to hit the shoulder of the bat, was perhaps the ball of the match.Thakur hails from Palghar, a town 87 km north of Mumbai, and spent his early cricketing years lugging his kitbag on early-morning trains into the city. Mumbai won the Ranji Trophy in his debut season of 2012-13, but he did not play a major role in the triumph, picking up only four wickets in four matches at an average of 82.Told to lose weight by his Mumbai team-mates, Thakur came back leaner and fitter the next season, and picked up 27 wickets at 26.25. The 2014-15 season was even better, Thakur finishing joint-top of the Ranji Trophy bowling charts with 48 wickets at 20.81. That earned him a call-up to the India A squad for four-day games against Australia A and South Africa A. Later that year, playing for the Board President's XI, he bagged a four-wicket haul against the touring South Africans, his wickets including those of Faf du Plessis and Hashim Amla.Kings XI Punjab signed Thakur for INR 20 lakhs at the 2014 IPL player auction, but he only got to play one match in his first two seasons for the team.ESPNcricinfo staff"
14,Washington Sundar,"October 05, 1999, Chennai, Tamil Nadu",23y 327d,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Bowling Allrounder,"Like R Ashwin from Tamil Nadu before him, Washington Sundar went from being a batsman as a youngster to making his name as an offspinner. After representing India at the 2016 Under-19 World Cup, he replaced Ashwin at Rising Pune Supergiant in the 2017 IPL, and bowled at an impressive economy rate to help his side to the final.Sundar's father, a cricketer who made it to the Tamil Nadu Ranji probables without getting into the final squad, named him Washington to honour his godfather, Mr Washington, who would buy bats for him and pay his fees. Sundar loved to bowl but only in matches because he found it boring to just field. He eventually started to take it seriously under the eye of former India offspiner M Venkataramana. Sundar bowls with great discipline, and held his own in domestic one-day competitions and after making his Twenty20 debut as a 17-year-old in the IPL."
15,Axar Rajeshbhai Patel,"January 20, 1994, Anand, Gujarat",29y 220d,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowling Allrounder,"Left-arm spinner Axar Patel has been increasingly handy with the bat in the lower order across formats - enough to be classified as a bowling allrounder. He played just one first-class game in his debut season for Gujarat, but had a more successful showing in 2013, when he was one of the key contributors to India Under-23s' title win in the ACC Emerging Teams Cup, with seven wickets, including a four-for in the semi-final against UAE. He was consistent for Gujarat with bat and ball in the Ranji Trophy that season, finishing with 369 runs at an average of 46.12 and 29 wickets at 23.58.Axar scored an IPL contract with Mumbai Indians ahead of the 2013 season but didn't get a game. He had a more impressive season the following year, after switching to Kings XI Punjab - 16 wickets at an economy rate of 6.22 - and was rewarded with a place in the Indian ODI squad for the tour to Bangladesh, though he only played one match.He made his T20 debut against Zimbabwe in 2015, but for the next three years found himself in and out of the limited-overs squads, stepping in more often than not in the absence of Ravindra Jadeja. His Test debut likewise came about when Jadeja was forced to sit out the 2021 England series with a broken thumb. Axar took five wickets on debut in the second Test in Chennai, and followed it up with an 11-wicket haul in the third: he finished the series with 27 wickets. In 2022, he made a 27-ball fifty, his first in ODIs, to seal a series win for India against West Indies."
16,Prithvi Pankaj Shaw,"November 09, 1999, Thane, Maharashtra",23y 292d,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Opening Batter,"Prithvi Shaw shot to prominence as a 14-year old when he scored 546 off 330 balls, an innings that contained 85 fours and five sixes, for his school Rizvi Springfield in the Harris Shield, an age-group cricket tournament in Mumbai in 2013. Shaw's innings was then the highest score in school cricket.In November 2016, Shaw was part of the India Under-19 squad that won the youth Asia Cup in Sri Lanka. Two months later, he made his Ranji Trophy debut for Mumbai in the semi-final against Tamil Nadu and scored a second-innings century that led his team to victory.In September 2017, at 17, Shaw became the youngest player to score a century on Duleep Trophy debut, a record previously held by Sachin Tendulkar. He was then named captain of the Under-19 World Cup squad, a tournament India went on to win. During the tournament, he was sold to Delhi Daredevils for INR 1.2 crore (USD 187,500 approx) in the 2018 IPL auction.Given an opportunity after their IPL campaign flagged midway, Shaw impressed head coach Ricky Ponting with his fearless batting against the new ball; ending with 245 runs in nine innings at a strike rate of 153.12. However, it was his performances for India A, both in England and at home against West Indies A and South Africa A, that gave wings to his India aspirations.He pipped Mayank Agarwal in the race to be India's back-up opener when he earned a call-up for the fourth and fifth Tests in England in 2018, and finally became India's 293rd Test cricketer in Rajkot against West Indies in November 2018 after India's selectors ran out of patience with Shikhar Dhawan. Shaw marked the occasion by becoming the youngest Indian Test centurion on debut, and just the second-youngest Test centurion for India after Sachin Tendulkar."
17,Deepak Lokandersingh Chahar,"August 07, 1992, Agra, Uttar Pradesh",31y 21d,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Bowler,"Deepak Chahar is a classical swing bowler who added T20 smarts to his game to pick up 6 for 7 against Bangladesh in 2019, then the best bowling figures in T20Is.After making a sensational first-class cricket debut for Rajasthan in 2010-11, taking 8 for 10 in Hyderabad's 21 all out, Chahar struggled with injuries and fitness. He then rediscovered himself as a T20 bowler, blossoming under the captaincy of MS Dhoni in Chennai Super Kings' triumphant return to the IPL in 2018. He did even better next season, finishing third on the wickets table, with 22 at a strike rate of 17.5, including 3 for 26 in the final. Super Kings paid US$1.8 million to keep him at the 2022 auction. However, a back injury ruled him out of that season's IPL and from the T20 World Cup, for which he was in the reserves, later in the year.A bowler in the mould of Praveen Kumar and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Chahar learned swing bowling at his father's coaching academy. Dhoni used him shrewdly with the new ball, often bowling him for three overs in the powerplay. Chahar also kept working on his other skills and turned himself into a capable bowler at the death, which was evident in that record-breaking spell against Bangladesh: four of his six wickets, including a hat-trick, came with a wet old ball in dewy conditions.Chahar is also a handy lower-order batter. In an ODI in Colombo in July 2021, he steered India's chase with an unbeaten 69 from No. 8."
18,Deepak Jagbir Hooda,"April 19, 1995, Rohtak",28y 131d,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"An allrounder who can bat in any position, Deepak Hooda also bowls offbreaks, offers plenty of athleticism as a boundary fielder, and is an asset in any T20 side. His big hitting as a 19-year-old in his debut IPL season, in 2015, earned with the nickname ""Hurricane Hooda"", but more importantly, got him a Rs 4.2 crore (US$ 622,000 approx) contract with Sunrisers Hyderabad at the next auction.Hooda's game is also suited to the longer formats. Appointed Baroda's captain at the start of the 2016-17 Ranji season, he reeled off three consecutive hundreds, including an unbeaten 293 against Punjab, but struggled to convert his starts thereafter. In 2021, Baroda suspended him for indiscipline after he left the T20 squad, having accused captain Krunal Pandya of ""bullying"" and using abusive language. He moved to Rajasthan the next season.But Hooda patched things up with Pandya before the start of the 2022 IPL, and had a breakout season for Lucknow Super Giants under Pandya's captaincy. Immediately after, he scored his maiden T20I hundred - in only his third innings - against Ireland in Malahide and found himself included in the 2022 T20 World Cup squad."
19,Krunal Himanshu Pandya,"March 24, 1991, Ahmedabad, Gujarat",32y 157d,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder,"Krunal Pandya, an allrounder and brother of Hardik Pandya, was drawn to the game as a result of his father Himanshu, taking his sons to the stadium in Vadodara when the cricket carnival came to town. The brothers started training at Kiran More's academy in the city. Krunal, who is seen as a limited-overs specialist, has played 4 List A games and 15 T20s for Baroda. However, he hasn't played since March 2015 due to a labral tear in his shoulder that required surgery. He did get picked up in the IPL auction by Mumbai Indians for INR 2 crores."
20,Manish Krishnanand Pandey,"September 10, 1989, Nainital, Uttaranchal",33y 352d,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Top order Batter,"Manish Pandey will always be remembered as the first Indian to score a century in the IPL. In one night, the 19-year-old went from being Karnataka's next big Ranji hope to entering the record books as he hit his way to the highest Twenty20 score by an Indian. That century also meant he would not have to carry out his intention of following his father into the army if he did not make it as a professional cricketer.But his barnstorming start did not immediately translate into an India call-up and Pandey continued to work his way up in the domestic circuit. His growth as an aggressive middle-order batsman and an athletic fielder coincided with Karnataka's rise as undisputed leaders of the domestic arena in a period that saw them complete the double treble. In July 2015, six years after that smash-mouth IPL hundred in Centurion, Pandey made his international debut in Harare.Pandey's breakout international innings, however, came six months later in Sydney. In January 2016, his unbeaten maiden ODI century helped India gun down Australia's 330 with two balls to spare and prevent a whitewash. While Pandey was not included in any of the T20 competitions India played in the lead-up to the World T20, he was brought in to replace an injured Yuvraj Singh in the semi-final against West Indies, where Pandey did not bat.

22,Mayank Anurag Agarwal,"February 16, 1991, Bangalore, Karnataka",32y 193d,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batter,"A prolific opening batsman since his Under-13 days with Bishop Cotton Boys' School, Bangalore, Mayank Agarwal modelled his style of batting on Virender Sehwag. Agarwal struck 432 runs at an average of 54 in five matches in the Under-19 Cooch Behar Trophy in 2008-09 and hit a match-winning 160 for India Under-19s, in a one-dayer against Australia Under-19s in Hobart in 2009.Agarwal was a bright spot in an otherwise disappointing Under-19 World Cup for India in 2010, top-scoring for his side in the tournament. Agarwal then graduated to the India A sides, but struggled for consistency.  Initially pigeonholed as a limited-overs specialist,  Agarwal made his Ranji Trophy debut for Karnataka in the 2013-14 season; he made his T20 debut in 2010-11 and List A debut in 2011-12.In the 2014-15 season, he was in the running to open for Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy, but was benched halfway through the season. According to Rahul Dravid, who worked with Agarwal in the India A side, it was a ""wake-up call"" for the opener. Agarwal lost weight in the off season, worked hard on his fitness, and scored his maiden first-class century the following season.He spent three seasons in the IPL with Royal Challengers Bangalore, from 2011 to 2013, scoring 492 runs in 35 matches, before moving to Delhi Daredevils in 2014. His stint with Daredevils was fairly muted in his first two seasons. ESPNcricinfo staff"
23,Mohammed Shami Ahmed,"September 03, 1990, Amroha, Uttar Pradesh",32y 359d,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Mohammed Shami was India's leading fast bowler in the 2015 World Cup in Australia, when the team marched into the semi-finals and picked up 77 out of 80 wickets on offer. It was later revealed that he had played through that entire tournament - and the preceding Test series against the hosts, essentially four months - through a knee injury. His success can be attributed to his pace, accuracy and primarily his skill in moving the ball - both old and new.There were plenty of frustrating times as well. Shami was hopeful of a return to the Indian team in early 2016, but a hamstring injury ruled him out a limited-overs tour of Australia and the Asia Cup in February. He was selected in a 15-man squad for the World T20 in March, but was unable to break into the XI having spent a year out of international cricket.Shami hails from Uttar Pradesh, but plays first-class cricket for Bengal from where he was noticed. He had played only 15 first-class and 15 List A games when he was drafted into India's ODI team to play Pakistan in Delhi in January 2013. He showed the faith wasn't misplaced and returned figures of 9-4-23-1 in a 10-run win, thus becoming only the eighth bowler, and the first Indian, to bowl four or more maiden overs on his ODI debut. His Test debut, which happened in November that year against the touring West Indies, was even more spectacular. He reverse-swung the old ball appreciably,  and at good pace, in the two-match series to take 11 wickets at 16.54. In the summer that followed in England, Shami and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, recorded the second-highest 10th wicket partnership for India in Tests, when they put on 111 runs against England in Nottingham.Shami's quick promotion to international cricket was the result of impressive performances in the 2012-13 Ranji Trophy: in five matches he took 28 wickets at 21.35, including two ten-wicket hauls, against Madhya Pradesh and Hyderabad. He has also enjoyed early success in the Twenty20 format, picking up 14 wickets in his first eight domestic Twenty20 games, and was signed by Kolkata Knight Riders for the 2011 IPL season. He got his first game for them in 2013, and was acquired by Delhi Daredevils in 2014, who retained him in 2016 despite his missing the entire 2015 season with injury. ESPNcricinfo staff"
24,Kuldeep Yadav,"December 14, 1994, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh",28y 257d,Left hand Bat,Left arm Wrist spin,Bowler,"Kuldeep Yadav started as a fast bowler when he first joined a cricket academy in Kanpur, but was asked by his coach Kapil Pandey to switch to something much rarer - left-arm wristspin. The change wasn't smooth - Kuldeep admitted that he had even tried once - but he soon realised bowling left-arm wristspin was the way forward for him. And he was good at it too, having not only solid control over the length, but also a potent wrong'un among his variations.There haven't been too many bowlers of his ilk in India, and Kuldeep, therefore, attracted immediate attention after successful stints at the Under-19 level.Kuldeep played his first India U-19 game in April 2012 as a 17-year old and and despite consistently taking wickets, he stayed below the radar.  It was the 2014 edition of the U-19 World Cup in Dubai that pushed his stocks higher. After a wicketless spell in the opening game against Pakistan, Kuldeep picked up a hat-trick in the next game against Scotland. ""As Kuldeep, mere ko wicket nikaalna hai (As Kuldeep, I knew I had to take wickets),"" he said after the match.He gained in stature in the games that followed, repeatedly troubling batsmen with his turn and finished with 14 wickets, the joint second-highest in the tournament. The performance seemed to justify why Kolkata Knight Riders' scouts had forked out $66,000 for him in the IPL auction prior to the Under-19 World Cup.Kuldeep had been part of the Mumbai Indians set-up in the 2012 season where he had a fond memory of bamboozling Sachin Tendulkar once in the nets with his wrong'un. That did not translate into an IPL debut. Nor did it happen with Knight Riders in the 2014 season. He had to wait until the Champions League where, playing as a support bowler to Sunil Narine, he impressed with his economy. Following those performances, he was included in India's ODI squad for the series against West Indies in October 2014, and he made his first-class and List A debuts shortly after.Having established himself in the Uttar Pradesh and India A sides, Kuldeep made his Test debut against Australia in a deciding match in Dharamsala in March 2017 and claimed 4 for 68 in the first innings.ESPNcricinfo staff"
25,Yuzvendra Singh Chahal,"July 23, 1990, Jind, Haryana",33y 36d,Right hand Bat,Legbreak Googly,Bowler,"Yuzvendra Chahal is an attacking legspinner who first attracted attention when he took 34 wickets in the National Under-19 Cooch Behar Trophy in 2009, ending the tournament as its leading wicket-taker. A former chess player who represented India at junior levels, Chahal made his first-class debut for Haryana the same year and was signed by Mumbai Indians in 2011 to be part of their IPL squad.He didn't play a game that season but was still named in Mumbai's Champions League T20 squad the same year. It was in the Champions League that he got an extended run in the side - he featured in the playing XI in all the matches and starred in Mumbai's win in the final with a spell of 3-0-9-2. However, in the next two years with Mumbai, he managed only one game. His IPL fortunes mirrored those in domestic cricket, where he played in only eight matches in three seasons from 2011-12 onwards and picked up just 16 wickets.It was with Royal Challengers Bangalore, though, that he found the bulk of his success. He was their highest wicket-taker for two years running since the 2015 season and by virtue of that earned his first India caps in ODIs and T20Is on a tour of Zimbabwe in June 2016. While that series may have been seen as an opportunity to blood new players into international cricket, Chahal was called up again into the Indian T20 line-up to face England in January 2017, and delivered in style in the deciding game: his 6 for 25 in that match in Bangalore was part of an England collaspse of 8 for 8, and the third-best figures till then in T20Is.ESPNcricinfo staff"
26,Kedar Mahadav Jadhav,"March 26, 1985, Pune, Maharashtra",38y 155d,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"Kedar Jadhav is an attacking middle-order batsman from Maharashtra who came into the limelight with a 29-ball 50 for Delhi Daredevils on his IPL debut. He scored six fifties and one century during the 2008-09 first-class season and those who have seen him bat for Maharashtra rate him as a natural Twenty20 player. Initially a part of the Royal Challengers Bangalore development squad, he was drafted in by Delhi, for whom his innings against Bangalore was a shot in the arm in a struggling season. He eventually returned to the Bangalore franchise in 2016.In the Ranji Trophy, he made a name for himself in 2013-14, finishing as the season's highest run-getter with 1223 runs including six centuries. He was one of the few bright spots in Daredevils' failed campaign in 2014 and his fulfilling season earned him an India call-up for the Bangladesh ODIs in June 2014. But he didn't make his debut till November that year, slotting in at No. 6 against Sri Lanka. His next two stints in the ODI squad were tours to Zimbabwe, one in July 2015 - where he scored an unbeaten century - and one in June 2016, where he didn't get to bat during any of India's three chases. This sporadic relation with the Indian team was finally cut short when he featured in all five ODIs against New Zealand at home in October 2016. His performances as the last recognized batsman in a team playing five bowlers - along with a newly-adopted skill in offspin - earned him a call up for the England series in January 2017, along with a semblance of security as an Indian player.ESPNcricinfo staff"
27,Ravichandran Ashwin,"September 17, 1986, Madras (now Chennai), Tamil Nadu",36y 345d,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Bowling Allrounder,"R Ashwin took the tricks and skills he learned playing tennis-ball cricket on the streets of Chennai, particularly the soduku ball, a finger-flicked legbreak, to Test cricket, where he became perhaps the leading offspinner of the first quarter of the 21st century.All through his career Ashwin has been a cricket nerd with a deep appreciation of the nuances of the game and an acute knowledge of his craft. And it was that sharp brain, along with the carrom ball, an equally good arm ball, and masterly control over his offbreaks that made him a quintessential limited-overs spinner early in his career. It was in Test cricket, though, that he became a force after he brought the full scope of his talents to bear on it.His success was desperately needed by India in the time after Anil Kumble retired and Harbhajan Singh was on the wane. Ashwin took nine wickets in his maiden Test, in which he was Player of the Match. In his first 16 Tests he collected nine five-fors, and he went on to be the fastest to 300 wickets and the second fastest to 400, behind only Muthiah Muralidaran.Among the highlights of Ashwin's Test career: 30 five-fors and counting, 90-odd wickets apiece against both Australia and England, and over 50 wickets a year four times. He reached his zenith in the 2016-17 home season, when he took 27 wickets in a three-Test series against New Zealand, 28 in five matches against England, six in a game against Bangladesh, and 21 against Australia in four Tests.Ashwin was picked by Chennai Super Kings in the IPL in 2009, and was one of the rare players who came into the public's reckoning through the IPL and proved himself good enough to have great success in Test cricket. He spent six seasons at CSK, winning the title twice, bowling at the top and the death, and coming on when wickets were required. He was the Man of the Series in the 2010 Champions League in South Africa.He was part of the winning squad in the 2011 World Cup, but got few chances in that tournament ahead of Harbhajan. In the 2015 tournament, he made up with 13 wickets from eight games in India's run to the semi-final. In T20Is his finest hour was the World Cup in 2014, when he took 4 for 11 against Australia, and 11 wickets in all in the tournament, where India lost in the final.An opener with the bat before he took up offspin, Ashwin has been a more than handy lower-order batter, correct, possessed of shots, and with five Test hundreds to his name."
28,Mohammed Siraj,"March 13, 1994, Hyderabad",29y 168d,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Mohammed Siraj's rise as a seamer was remarkably swift. The son of an autorickshaw driver in Hyderabad, he only began playing the game in class seven. It was in 2015 that he first bowled with a cricket ball. In 2017, he bagged an IPL contract worth INR 2.6 crore. Months later, he was wearing an India shirt and bowling in a T20 international against New Zealand.Sturdy and athletic, Siraj has a deceptive run-up, which initially suggests that a left-arm bowler is steaming in. He is, however, a right-armer and by his own admission is a natural at getting the ball to swing into the right-hander. He has always been able to bowl a pretty quick bouncer though, something that had impressed his captain David Warner and team mentor VVS Laxman in the Sunrisers Hyderabad set-up.Potential translated to performance when he was his state's highest wicket-taker playing only his second season of Ranji Trophy - 41 wickets in nine matches. He was subsequently picked to play for the Rest of India and was brought on board by the India A team as well for a tour of South Africa in July-August 2017. The step up to the big league arrived soon after."
29,Jasprit Jasbirsingh Bumrah,"December 06, 1993, Ahmedabad",29y 265d,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Jasprit Bumrah grabbed eyeballs first with his unorthodox action, and then his bowling skills. Armed with an anomalous, sling-arm action and natural pace, the peculiar release point of Bumrah's deliveries makes it hard for batsmen to pick him.Besides, like his Mumbai Indians team-mate, Lasith Malinga, Bumrah carved himself a reputation for possessing an uncanny ability to hit the blockhole. And, it was during his time in the IPL that he learned from the Sri Lankan to judiciously use the yorker.A regular member of the India A team, Bumrah was on the fringes of national selection before a debilitating left knee injury at the end of 2014 kept him out for four-and-a-half months. He had to wait more than a year before earning another call-up, one which came on the back of a fruitful 2015-16 domestic season, where he was Gujarat's second-highest wicket-taker in the Ranji Trophy and topped the bowling charts in the Vijay Hazare Trophy - that included a five-for in the List-A final that gave Gujarat their maiden one-day title.Those performances, and an untimely injury to Mohammed Shami, meant Bumrah took the flight to Australia, where he played a central role for India, finishing as the highest wicket-taker from either side as the visitors swept the T20Is 3-0. It was a showing that earned him the praise of MS Dhoni - who called him the find of the tour - as well as a place in India's squad for the 2016 World T20.ESPNcricinfo staff"
30,Ruturaj Dashrat Gaikwad,"January 31, 1997, Pune, Maharashtra",26y 209d,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batter,"Ruturaj Gaikwad entered the Indian cricket fan's consciousness with a bang in 2021, when he made a whopping 635 runs for title winners Chennai Super Kings. The previous season the franchise had taken a punt on Gaikwad as one for the future, slotting him in as an anchoring opener who could attack when needed. They gave him six games and he showed what he was capable of, with over 200 runs.Towards the pointy end of the 2021 tournament, Gaikwad made 70 in the qualifier against Delhi Capitals and put on a partnership of 61 with Faf du Plessis in the final, taking CSK to 192, which turned out to be plenty. Fresh off that success, he captained Maharashtra in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament and made 259 runs.Gaikwad's first-class, List A and T20 debuts came in 2016-17, and he shone in the middle format, with 444 runs, the third highest in the Vijay Hazare Trophy that year. He showed he had the game for all requirements when he produced 187 not out against Sri Lanka A in a List A game June 2019, and later in the year, a hundred and a fifty against Chhatisgarh in the Ranji Trophy."
31,Bhuvneshwar Kumar Singh,"February 05, 1990, Meerut, Uttar Pradesh",33y 204d,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Bowler,"At the time of his India debut in 2012, Bhuvneshwar Kumar seemed the answer to the side's fast-bowling scarcity; though middling in pace, he produced swing both ways and had a devastating inswinger. In his first T20I over, he bowled Nasir Jamshed; with his first ODI delivery, he bowled Mohammad Hafeez; and in his first Test series he played a part in India's first whitewash win in a four-Test series, against Australia in 2013.Bhuvneshwar demonstrated his mastery of line and length early, when at 19 he worked Sachin Tendulkar over for his first duck in domestic first-class cricket, in the 2008-09 Ranji Trophy final. He was handy with the bat too - in the 2012-13 Duleep Trophy semi-final he scored 128 batting at No. 8.He was one of the lone bright spots on India's otherwise wretched tour of England in 2014, taking 19 wickets - including 6 for 82 in the win at Lord's -at 26.63. However, an ankle injury in Australia put him out of commission for most of the next year, and he played just one game in the 2015 ODI World Cup. When he returned he wasn't quite the same bowler - he had traded swing for increased pace, but not always effectively. Despite two more five-fors in 2016, against West Indies away and New Zealand at home, his appearances in Tests became more sporadic as injuries dogged him, and he played his last series against South Africa in 2018.It was in white-ball cricket that Bhuvneshwar found his niche. In 2013, six months into his ODI career, he picked up 4 for 8 against Sri Lanka in a tri-series game in the Caribbean, and finished as the leading wicket-taker with ten wickets in four games. By 2017 he had formed a devastating partnership with Jasprit Bumrah, and developed slower balls and yorkers that made him India's go-to bowler at the death. In February 2018, he became the second Indian bowler after Yuzvendra Chahal to take five wickets in a T20I, against South Africa in Johannesburg. In 2022, he went one better, picking up 5 for 4 against Afghanistan in the Asia Cup.Bhuvneshwar's rise in white-ball cricket mirrored his success in the IPL. He was handed a contract by Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2009 but went two seasons without playing a game in the tournament. After another three unremarkable seasons with Pune Warriors, he was signed by Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2014, and quickly rose through the ranks to become the lynchpin of their powerplay and death bowling. He took upwards of 18 wickets in each of his first four seasons, won the purple cap two years in a row, in 2016 and 2017, and was instrumental in Sunrisers' only title win, in 2016. Though his performances tapered off in later seasons, he remains the franchise's all-time leading wicket-taker."

He took 28 wickets in the wins in 2019 and 2020, playing nearly all the team's games. The year after, fresh off two T20Is against England, when Mumbai had a middling season, he did just as well, taking 13 wickets and finishing as their second most prolific wicket-taker.Like many leggies who make an impact in T20, Chahar is not a big turner of the ball, but has good loop and drift, and makes subtle use of his variations in length and pace.Like his cousin Deepak, Chahar plays for Rajasthan in the Ranji Trophy, for whom he made his first-class and List A debuts in 2016-17. Two seasons on, though the team had a dismal outing in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, Chahar was third on the wicket-takers' list for the tournament, with 20."
